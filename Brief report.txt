Single Shot object Detection (SSD) using MobileNet and OpenCV were used to detect people. A bounding box is displayed around every person detected.

To detect the distance of people from camera, triangle similarity technique was used. Let us assume that a person is at a distance D (in centimetres) from camera and the person's actual height is H (I have assumed that the average height of humans in 165 centimetres). Using the object detection code above, we can identify the pixcel height P of the person using the bounding box coordinates. Using these values, the focal length of the camera can be calculated using the below formula:

Eq 1: F = (P x D) / H
After calculating the focal length of the camera, we can use the actual height H of the person, pixcel height P of the person and focal length of camera F to calculate the distance of the person from camera. Distance from camera can be calculated using:

Eq 2: D' = (H x F) / P
Now that we know the depth of the person from camera, we can move on to calculate the distance between two people in a video. There can be n number of people detected in a video. So the Euclidean distance is calculated between the mid-point of the bounding boxes of all the people detected. By doing this, we have got our x and y values. These pixels values are converted into centimetres using Eq 2.

How to run:
cd to webpage directory and type in the terminal: 'python app.py'

However, you can manually run the detection part by running the 'Detector.ipynb' file
